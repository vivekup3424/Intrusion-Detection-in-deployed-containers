# Intrusion and Anamoly Detection system on containers

# and resource-intensive application

1. The project's focus is on leveraging technology and integrated networks
   to enable ongoing learning, early detection of anomalies, and
   continuous training.
2. Leveraging intrusion detection and anomaly detection strategies is crucial to safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring
   system integrity. But this has been a challenge to develop due to data privacy
   and security issues
